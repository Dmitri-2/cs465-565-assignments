# CS 465 Assignments 

This repository is for assignments done for CS 465: Web Development 

## Assignment #0 

Setup done, as can be seen here :)

## Assignment #1 

- The different excersises are in their respective files. 
- I chose to replicate the HTML structure of Slack (www.slack.com) for exercise2. 

## Assignment #2

- All exercises done in their respective files. 
- I did as much CSS as I could for Slack. Without using more advanced layout techniques (grid, float, etc...) it was a little hard to replicate the site's layout. 
- Added CSS to personal profile page from Assignent #1. 

## Assignment #3 

- All exercises done in their respective files. 
- I used the following layouts for the exercises:
    - Layout 1:  Bootstrap Grid 
    - Layout 2:  Regular Grid
    - Layout 3:  Flexbox 
    - Layout 4:  Bootstrap Grid
    - Layout 5:  Inline-Block

- Layout 6 was not done as it was listed as optional 

## Assignment #4 

- All exercises done in their respective files. 
- I tried to keep all JS code as basic as possible, utilizing the built-in functions of the language. 
- I used jQuery for almost all DOM interaction. 

## Assignment #5

- This assignemnt was set up using `express-generator` to create the basic setup/files. 
- I then did the assignment in the `app.js` and `index.js`, and placed my HTML page in the public folder. 
- I removed all unnecessary code and directories. 

## Assignment #6

I chose to do the following tutorials: 

1. Intro to React (code in `react-tutorial`)
2. Mini Workshop 1 - Build a Simple Pet Fetching Web Application (code in `vue-workshop`)
3. Build a Node.js Web App using Google Cloud Platform (code in `node-codelab`)

I had a hard time finishing #3 because of a problem with the `google-cloud` package, 
but other than that, these tutorials went smoothly. 

Note: For assignment #6, most of the code was pre-written and I only followed/completed the tuorials as instructed.
